## Sending History Record to ETD
This folder demonstrates sending history to the ETD blockchain and the ETD file storage.

## Input document:
1. history.txt
2. history (1).txt

**Remark**: 
* They were generated by clicking the submit button on the Manage History Page of the chrome extension
* No quantity limit

# Requirements
* json
* hashlib
* Crypto
* datetime

## How to run
* The script (send2blockchain.py) is assumed to be in the same location as the history.txt file download from the extension
	* We have two hitory files here for the purpose of demonstration
* Use Python 3 to execute send2blockchain.py
	* send2blockchain.ipynb has the same content as the execute send2blockchain.py

## Procedures in the Script
1. Load the ETD account
	* Create one if it does not exist
2. Generate a document including the user profile and search history
3. Send a transaction with the hash value of the document to ETD Blockchain
4. Load the sent password for DES encryption
	* Create a password if it does not exist. Input by the user
5. Encrypt the document using DES encryption with the defined password
6. Send the encrypted document along with the user profile to ETD file storage

## Output document
The document generated in step 6 of the procedures is saved as a binary file under ./document/
